# All Night BBCode

[*All Night Laundry*](http://www.all-night-laundry.com/) is a great webcomic (as you probably know if you're reading this),
but its migration from the now-defunct MSPA Forums has left some broken BBCode tags in places. This userscript
fixes them.

## Installation

To install, make sure you have [userscript support](https://greasyfork.org/en/help/installing-user-scripts) and go to [the raw script](https://github.com/AjaxGb/AllNightBBCode/raw/master/AllNightBBCode.user.js). Your userscript plugin should handle it from there.

## More Details

Here are the broken tags I've seen and fixed thus far:

- `[size]`
- `[quote]`
- `[strike]`

If I notice more as I reread the comic, I'll update the script.

Please do make a [bug report](https://github.com/AjaxGb/AllNightBBCode/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) if you spot one I missed,
or notice the script otherwise messing up!
